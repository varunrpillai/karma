    <string name="dialogMessage">Karma is not just an ordinary task manager but a daily assistant to condition your character/behavior. It allows you to add a maximum of 7 Karmas. Karmas that I refer here are those habits/behavior/task which you want to improve and considered most important in your life. It could be even a desire of something which you want to avoid.  You could hit the pending icon for each karma to mark it as done for the day. Based on your completion of your karma for the day, you build a beautiful garden in your home screen.</string>
